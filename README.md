# Guessing Game Project for Data Structure Course

# Description
The Guessing Game project is developed as part of the Data Structure course. It aims to implement a game similar to Akinator, where the user thinks of an object or character, and the program attempts to guess what they are thinking by asking a series of yes/no questions. The project explores the application of data structures, specifically binary trees, to efficiently narrow down the possibilities and make accurate guesses.

# Features
The Guessing Game project offers the following features:

Binary Tree: The game utilizes a binary tree data structure to represent a series of questions and objects. Each node in the tree contains a question, and the branches represent yes/no answers leading to different objects.

User Interaction: The program interacts with the user by asking questions and accepting their responses. It analyzes the answers to traverse the binary tree and refine its guess.

Learning and Updating: If the program fails to guess the object correctly, it learns from the user's input and asks for a new question that differentiates the correct object from the guessed one. It then updates the binary tree structure to improve future guesses.

Persistence: The project includes a mechanism to save the current state of the binary tree to a file, allowing the game to resume from where it left off in subsequent sessions.

# Getting Started
To get started with the Guessing Game project, follow these steps:

Installation: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local development environment.

Dependencies: Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed, such as a suitable programming language and development environment (e.g., Java and an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ).

Build and Run: Compile the project and run the main game file. Make sure all dependencies are resolved successfully.

Game Initialization: When the game starts, it loads the binary tree from a file if available. Otherwise, it begins with a default set of questions and objects.

Playing the Game: The program prompts the user to think of an object and proceeds to ask yes/no questions to narrow down the possibilities. The user responds to each question accordingly.

Game Outcome: Once the program makes a guess, it asks the user whether it is correct or not. If the guess is incorrect, it prompts the user to provide the correct object and a differentiating question.

Learning and Updating: The program learns from the user's input and updates the binary tree structure with the new question and object, ensuring improved future guesses.

Persistence: The game saves the current state of the binary tree to a file at the end of each session. This allows the game to resume from where it left off in subsequent sessions.

# Contributing
The Guessing Game project welcomes contributions from the open-source community. If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow these steps:

Fork the Guessing Game repository from GitHub.

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.

Make the necessary changes and additions to the codebase, ensuring that the data structures and algorithms used adhere to the course's requirements.

Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they do not introduce any new issues.

Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

Create a pull request, providing a detailed description of the changes you made and the problem they address.
